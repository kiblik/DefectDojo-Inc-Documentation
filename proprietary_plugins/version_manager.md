## Version Manager

The version manager within DefectDojo provides support for managing the base DefectDojo version by periodically checking for new versions of DefectDojo in one of the following locations: _DefectDojo Open Source_ or _Pro Offerings via DefectDojo's GCP Artifact Registry_.

To view the current DefectDojo version information of a given instance, navigate to the _Version Manager Settings_ page within the sidebar.

## Version Manager Settings

Within the _Version Manager Settings_ page, you will find all the necessary information regarding the DefectDojo version, as well as options to elect for automatic updates, and set a reminder date to check for updates.

## Version Manager Notifications

When the reminder date set in the _Version Manager Settings_ page is reached, a popup will be displayed that allows the user to either postpone the upgrade reminder, or perform the upgrade.

If the user wishes to begin the upgrade when the reminder is shown, the _Update Now_ button can be selected, which will then begin the upgrade process.
