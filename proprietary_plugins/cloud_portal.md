## Cloud Manager

Cloud Manager removes the need to use the DefectDojo [cloud site](https://www.cloud.defectdojo.com) to update firewall rules, preferred maintenance schedule, and submit support inquiries. In addition, the Cloud Manager provides messaging capabilities for SaaS management to communicate with subscription holders.

_Note:_ Cloud Manager is only available to DefectDojo cloud subscribers. The DefectDojo [cloud site](https://www.cloud.defectdojo.com) is also still required for updating or modifying billing information.

## Message Portal

The Message Portal acts as a secondary method of communication, outside of email, for cloud management to communicate with cloud subscription holders. Important information such as cancellation dates, bug reports, and trial expiration dates are all examples of data that may be shared with subscription holders by the messenger.

__Message Notifications__

New messages are collected automatically by DefectDojo. When new messages are received, they will be displayed as popups. After reviewing the contents of the popup, the message can be closed by selecting _Acknowledge_.

__Message Portal__

All previously received notifications will be stored and accessible within the message portal. To access previously received messages, navigate to the _Message Portal_ page under the _Cloud Manager_ tab within the sidebar.

Within the message portal, all previously received messages will be listed. As with other objects in DefectDojo, messages can be filtered to find a specific message faster. Although messages are collected automatically, if a user wishes to check for new messages manually, the _Refresh_ button will pull any new messages that may exist.

To view a specific message in full, select the eyeball under the actions column for a specific message. After being redirected, all of the details regarding a specific message will be displayed.

## Firewall Rules

Firewall rules restrict whch IP addresses are able to access a given DefectDojo instance. To update or modify existing firewall rules that may have been added in the cloud portal, navigate to the _Firewall Rules_ page under the _Cloud Manager_ tab within the sidebar.

![Accessing Firewall Rules](../../../images/cloud_manager/nav-cm-fr.png)

To add a new firewall rule, select the _Add New Rule_ button under the existing rules. This will prompt for a new IP address, mask, and label.

To remove a firewall rule, use the _Remove_ button to the right of the rule details.

![Adding Firewall Rules](../../../images/cloud_manager/cm-fr-add.png)

In addition to custom firewall rules, DefectDojo offers bulk whitelisting of IP addresses used by GitHub and Jira. If these services communicate with your DefectDojo instance, it may be required for these external services to be enabled.

To enable or disable a specific external service, use the checkbox to the left of the service's label (i.e. when checked the service is enabled, when unchecked the service is disabled).

To save any changes that have been made to new or exsting firewall rules, use the _Submit_ button. Please note, firewall rule propgation is not instant, and may take a few minutes for the update to take effect.

## Maintenance Schedule

Occasionally, DefectDojo cloud subscriptions may need to experience downtime for bugfixes and upgrades. The maintenance schedule allows cloud subscription maintainers to perform neccessary changes to your DefectDojo subscription without interrupting your workflow.

## Contact Support

The contact support page allows for a direct line of communication to the cloud management team from within DefectDojo. This is the fastest method of communication between DefectDojo customers and DefectDojo cloud maintainers.

![Accessing Contact Support](../../../images/cloud_manager/nav-cm-cs.png)

To submit a new support inquiry, navigate to the _Contact Support_ page under the _Cloud Manager_ tab within the sidebar.

![Contact Support Form](../../../images/cloud_manager/cm-cs-view.png)
